This is the third time I am writing this read.me for this project. I am exhausted to say the least. I got stuck with trying to streamline with jQuery, what I originally started with .I downloaded someone else's code off the internet, believing that I could simplify this code ..the many code and indivitual listing of each time slot etc. I know that there is a way to put each slot into an array and make a function for each array and shortten this up. Things started falling apart and reverted the code to working in the longer format.   In the end, I need to be done with this so that I could move on and keep up with class. like it was stated in the beginning, The best coders are those who google. SO I googled. I put a sample of what I was tryig to do in comments to show my thinking and will be working with my tutor to see if I was on the right track or not. 

As I was making my final pushes out, git started acting up on me. I even started a new repritore because of the way it was acting up. I have since updated my git version and am hoping this will solve it.
